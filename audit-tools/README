Network and BTA audit tools.

Looks at Cisco configs and BTA configs and attempts to report
various discrepencies. 
It wraps the data representation of BTA, SNMP, Flowrules and DB
into classes.  You can run this with a subset of cisco config
files.  Having all the cisco configs can take a while to run
this stuff. I generally do a pop at a time. ie. grab all the
Haymarket configs only.

cisco_view.py     
db_view.py        
flowrule_view.py  
snmp_view.py

1. Report interfaces that are 'up' on routers and missing in bta 

   ./audit.py -i

2. Check static routing in config against bta. For interface routes
   that are /30, the other end is reported.
   
   ./audit.py -r

3. Report customer link discrepancies between bta and router
   This reports 'all'. ie. interfaces and routes

   ./audit.py -a

4. Check the flowrules Makefile for routers that should
   have netflow 'on' and check the interfaces listed for
   those routers in the group sections of the monolithic 
   flowrules.conf file.

   ./getcfg.sh   = Retrieve current router config files from wocha
   ./netflow_check.py  > report.out
