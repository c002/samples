Version 1.0 Nov-2006

A Multithreaded modular snmp collector tool.

Short version:
* a UNIX box of some sort
* Need GNU make
* Need libtool
* Need net-snmp (probably version >= 5) 

 	mkdir build; cd build
	../configure
	gmake install

* When running configure, you prolly want to use --prefix and --with-snmp
eg. ../configure --prefix=/opt/snmp/cSnmp --with-snmp=/opt/snmp/net531

* To run, you need a config file to make it do something useful.
  See example in etc/sample.conf

  eg. /opt/snmp/cSnmp/bin/cSnmpCron -c /opt/snmp/cSnmp/etc/sample.conf 

  ./cSnmpCron [-n] [-r] [-h] [-v] -c configfile
        -c configfile = Where Configfile contains target lists and thread limits.
        -n = Don't run as daemon.
        -r = respawn daily. Bugs in snmplib workaround
        -h = this help.
        -v = version string.

  Some additional thread debugging can be done using: --with-trace  on
  the configure

* SunPro compiler.
  Prefix PATH with /opt/SUNwPro:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/local/bin
  configure line 2503  add "" in the for ac_lib

  See 'doc' for some usage info and config file details.
