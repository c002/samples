Notes Jun-2011

What it is:

A multithreaded SNMP poller based on Net-SNMP that is designed 
to poll many interfaces and routers quickly and often.  
It is customizable with modules that target OID's of interest.

It is config file driven and a crontab like syntax to specify what
needs polling when.  It stores the results in flat text files
which can be easily manipulated.

This project dates back to 2006 with some mods in 2008.
It is still used in 2011 and has been stable. It runs on 
a bunch of Sparc Solaris hosts collecting usage data from
all router interfaces on the ISP Company (what is now a legacy) network. 

I find it usefull and would hate to see usefull things dissappear.
Perhaps others may get some use out of this also.
