Create a new keystore from a new PFX (PKCS12)

1) Use pfx2jks.sh

or

2a) import it into Internet Explorer:

   Tools->Internet Options->Content->Certificates->import

    Accept empty password and mark key as exportable (or it won't enable the export private key later)
    After "Finish", should say successful import.

2b) Export this key

   as .PFX and include all certificates and uncheck "enable strong encryption", although I don't think this really
   matters. It will want a password for exporting the private component. Set this to "testing" and save the file somewhere.

2c) Import this PFX into its own java keystore

   pfx2jks.sh PFX_File JKS_File

   It is suggested to use a common prefix for all the keystores that are to
   be used.  These can then be easily and auto globbed during daily runs.

2d) Drop this JKS file into the "resources" dir and it will be picked
   up by the linxfaults.sh script that should run daily (may depend on prefix)
