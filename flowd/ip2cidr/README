This directory contains the IP to CIDR (and CIDR to CIDR) storage and lookup
library.

It also contains the persistant memory allocation library that uses a general
purpose memory allocation library over the top of an mmap()'ed file to
provide persistency to allocated memory.

The two files need to compiled in as:

$CC $CFLAGS -o progname $CFILES ip2cidr.c mpmalloc.c -lthread $LIBRARIES
