<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<I>flowd</I> dumps flows from a Cisco netflow feed to a cyclic series of files
<I>flowd.</I>

<P>

Run
<I>flowd</I>

as root if 
<I>-c </I>

is given since it will need to attach to the BGP shared memory segment
created by the bgp process.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Help. Show command usage
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Don't fork and run as foreground process. The default is to run as daemon
<DT><B>-p port</B>

<DD>
The UDP port to listen on for netflow packets. The default is 9992
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Dump BGP communities information also (4 max). This increases the data per flow
from 46 bytes to 64 bytes.
<DT><B>-t Hours</B>

<DD>
The number of hours of history to keep. Data files will be recycled within this period.
<DT><B>-f Flush</B>

<DD>
The number of seconds to accumulate flows in memory, after which time these are flushed
to the next data file. One good reason to flush data often, is that memory consumption
can be an issue. You don't want this to get into a swap situation as flow collection
may suffer.
<DT><B>-d Dumpdir</B>

<DD>
The directory where the data files are to be written. The default is /var/log/netflow/trace
<DT><B>-r rate</B>

<DD>
Rate limiting is provided to give some protection against DOS attacks and the make the
maximum file size somewhat predictable. (64 bytes per flow with BGP communities,
and 46 bytes without). When the rate limit is breached, netflow packets are dropped.
This is based on a per second bases.  So within the second some but not all data will
be lost. 
<BR>

<P>
To keep 24Hrs of data at a sustained flowrate of 10,000 flows/sec at 64 byte flow
records would require approximately 55 Gbytes.
<BR>

<P>
Identical flows are combined by adding the octets to and from and incrementing 
the flowcount indicator (See output Format). Flows are also tested for bi-directionality
and combined into one. This attempts to save space.
<P>
A log 
<I>flowd.log</I>

is written to the data directory containing various diagnostics. 
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OUTPUT FORMAT</H2>

<P>
The output is a set of binary data with the following C-structures.
<BR>

<P>
Firstly a small header is written
<BR>

<PRE>

typedef struct
{
    char  sig1;                    /* File signature 'F' */
    char  sig2;                    /* File signature 'O' */
    char  sig3;                    /* File signature 'O' */
    unsigned char  version;        /* 10 = 1.0, 44=4.4,  200=20.0  */
    char  options[4];              /* options affecting size of struct */
} header;

This is followed by the flowdata structures as:

typedef struct
{
    time_t    timestamp;   /* From unix_secs in the netflow header */
    ulong_t   srcIP;       /* Source IP address */
    ulong_t   dstIP;       /* Destination IP address */
    ulong_t   packets_to;  /* Number of packets in the flow */
    ulong_t   packets_from;/* Number of packets in the flow */
    ulong_t   bytes_to;    /* Number of bytes in the flow */
    ulong_t   bytes_from;  /* Number of bytes in the flow */
    ushort_t  srcIDB;      /* Source interface */
    ushort_t  dstIDB;      /* Destination interface */
    ushort_t  srcport;     /* Source port */
    ushort_t  dstport;     /* Destination port */
    ushort_t  protocol;    /* Protocol number */
    ushort_t  srcAS;       /* Peer AS of source address */
    ushort_t  dstAS;       /* Peer AS of destination address */
    ushort_t  bi;          /* 1=bi-directional , 0=Uni-directional */
    ushort_t  flows;       /* Number of flows for this one */
                           /* size = 46 */
    ushort_t  communities_len;
    uint32_t  community1;   
    uint32_t  community2;   
    uint32_t  community3;   
    uint32_t  community4;   
                           /* size=64 */
} tracedetails;

If no BGP communities are being collected, the first 46 bytes only are used.

<H2>SIGNALS</H2>

The 
<I>SIGUSR1 </I>

signal will immediatly flush to the next trace file.
The 
<I>SIGUSR2 </I>

signal toggles debug on/off. This will create a file &quot;debug.0&quot;
that is similar to the trace files but outputs the flows without tallying
duplicates and reverse flows.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

To store 24 hours of history with data being saved every 5 minutes with BGP
communities.
