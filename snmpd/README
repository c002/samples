This dir contains the necessary files to compile up a 
'net-snmp-5.08' snmpd agent that includes various netflow info
as extracted from bdf files on meters where such an snmpd agent would
run. It may even work with other net-snmp versions.

First build the net-snmp-5.08 as per instructions.

Add the module flowtagTable.[ch] to agent/mibgroups
Rerun the 'configure' with the additional option to
include the netflow module: 

./configure  --prefix=whateva --with-mib-modules="flowtagTable"
( May have to replace -lcrypto with -lcrypt )

To build the module, it needs to be linked against the btalib bdf_api:
   
   cd to subdir 'agent'

   Check the parameters in flowtagTable.h 

   Edit the mibgroups/Makefile and add
	CPPFLAGS=-I${BTALIB_PATH}
   Edit the Makefile and add 
	LOCAL_LIBS=-L${BTALIB_PATH} -lbta -lbdf_api
	Add $(LOCAL_LIBS) at end of LIBS

   Do a 'make' and 'make install', it should build clean and 
   produce a 'snmpd'

   Drop a netflow*.bdf file in NETFLOW_DIR and you
   should be able to run it on a localhost and succesfully
   do something like: 

   snmpwalk -v 1  -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.17548

The netflow MIB is described in the CCA*.txt SMI files.

Deploying

The following shared libs are required:
	libnetsnmp.so.5
	libnetsnmpagent.so.5
	libnetsnmphelpers.so.5
	libnetsnmpmibs.so.5
put these in meter:/opt/snmp/lib

A snmpd.conf is required, put this in meter:/opt/snmp/etc

A startup script like:

--
#!/bin/sh

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/snmp/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

#/opt/snmp/sbin/snmpd -l /var/log/snmpd.log -C -c /opt/snmp/etc/snmpd.conf
/opt/snmp/sbin/snmpd -f -l /var/log/snmpd.log -L -D -V -d -C -c /opt/snmp/etc/snmpd.conf

--
Should get things going.
